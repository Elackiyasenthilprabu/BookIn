// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    await tester.pumpWidget(const BookExchangeApp());

    // Verify that splash screen loads with title

    // Advance time past the splash duration to finish timers and transition
